Applying Machine Learning (ML) to solve real problems accurately and robustly requires more than just training the latest ML model. First, you will learn practical techniques to deal with data. This matters since real data is often not independently and identically distributed. It includes detecting covariate, concept, and label shifts, and modeling dependent random variables such as the ones in time series and graphs. Next, you will learn how to efficiently train ML models, such as tuning hyper-parameters, model combination, and transfer learning. Last, you will learn about fairness and model explainability, and how to efficiently deploy models. This is a full semester class that teaches both statistics, algorithms and code implementations. Homeworks and the final project emphasize solving real problems.
